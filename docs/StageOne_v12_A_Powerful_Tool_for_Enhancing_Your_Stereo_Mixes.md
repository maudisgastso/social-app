StageOne v1.2 is an innovative and great sounding processor that can change the width of existing stereo content, even moving it beyond the speakers. You can also add depth to existing recordings, making them sound bigger and more spacious. And if you need to upmix mono signals to stereo, or widen the phantom center in a stereo recording, you can use the mono spread feature that utilizes a unique filter design.
 
All of this is done at the highest quality with no compromise, thanks to the high-quality audio processing algorithms and the beautiful retina interface with a unique design that focuses on the optimal workflow. StageOne v1.2 is available as a 64-bit plugin for VST, VST3, AAX and AU formats, on macOS (10.10 and higher) and Windows 8 and 10.
 
StageOne v1.2 is ideal for mixing and mastering engineers who want to enhance their stereo mixes with more width, depth and clarity. It can also be useful for producers and musicians who want to create more immersive and realistic soundscapes for their music.
 
If you want to learn more about StageOne v1.2 and hear some audio examples, you can visit the official website of Leapwing Audio[^1^]. You can also download a free trial version and test it yourself on your own mixes.
 
StageOne v1.2 is currently available for a special introductory price of $149 (regular price $199). You can purchase it online from the Leapwing Audio store or from authorized dealers.
 
Don't miss this opportunity to take your stereo mixes to the next level with StageOne v1.2!
  
StageOne v1.2 is not only a powerful tool for enhancing your stereo mixes, but also a very easy and intuitive plugin to use. You can adjust the width, depth and mono spread parameters with simple sliders, and see the changes in real time on the stereo field display. You can also solo each parameter to hear its effect in isolation, and use the bypass button to compare the processed and unprocessed signals.
 
Another great feature of StageOne v1.2 is that it is mono downmix compatible, meaning that it preserves the balance and phase coherence of your stereo mixes when they are played back in mono. This is very important for ensuring that your mixes translate well on different playback systems and devices.
 
StageOne v1.2 is also very CPU efficient, so you can use it on multiple tracks without worrying about overloading your system. You can also save and recall your own presets, or use the factory presets that are included for different types of sources and genres.
 
Whether you want to add some subtle enhancement or some dramatic transformation to your stereo mixes, StageOne v1.2 can help you achieve your sonic goals with ease and quality. It is a plugin that you will want to use on every mix!
